# trapperkeeper-rpc

This library enables transparent RPC implementation for [TrapperKeeper](https://github.com/puppetlabs/trapperkeeper)
services. It provides two things:

 * A `call-remote-svc-fn` function used to implement a proxied version
   of a given TK service protocol
 * An RPC server service
   (`puppetlabs.trapperkeeper.rpc.services.rpc-server-service`) that
   exposes proxied service implementations over HTTP.

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/puppetlabs/trapperkeeper-rpc/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/puppetlabs/trapperkeeper-rpc)

## Feature Overview

 * Uses [transit](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-clj) to do
   (de)serialization. Choice of JSON or msgpack as the underlying wire
   format (the latter being the default).
 * Optional Per-service certificate whitelisting
 * HTTP or HTTPS
 * Per-service endpoints
 * Robust error reporting

Planned features:

 * basic API for adding custom (de|en)coders
 * support for ignoring (defn-) defined functions

## Example usage

```clojure
(ns gnarlytimes.services
    (:require [puppetlabs.trapperkeeper.core :refer [defservice]]
              [puppetlabs.trapperkeeper.rpc.core :refer [defremoteservice]]))

;; (note: TK best practices are eschewed for the sake of brevity)

;; A service protocol
(defprotocol MathService
    (add [this x y])
    (divide [this x y]))

;; The traditional (or "concrete") implementation of the MathService protocol
(defservice math-service
    MathService
    []
    (add [this x y] (+ x y))
    (divide [this x y] (/ x y)))

;; A proxied implementation of MathService for use via RPC
(defremoteservice remote-math-service
    MathService
    (add [this x y])
    (divide [this x y]))
```

Given the following config:

```clojure
  {:rpc {;; currently supported: :msgpack and :json, both via transit
         :wire-format :msgpack

         ;; settings for making signed requests to the rpc server
         :ssl {:client-cert "dev-resources/ssl/client-cert.pem"
               :client-key "dev-resources/ssl/client-key.pem"
               :client-ca "dev-resources/ssl/ca.pem"}


         ;; This maps service IDs to RPC settings used by both the RPC
         ;; client and server components.
         :services {:MathService
                    {;; used by the RPC server service to find service functions
                     :protocol-ns "gnarlytimes.services"
                     ;; each service's RPC endpoint can have its own cert whitelist
                     :certificate-whitelist "dev-resources/ssl/math-service-cert-whitelist"
                     ;; the client uses this to issue RPC calls
                     :endpoint "https://localhost:9002/rpc/call"}}}

   ;; a webserver that will listen for RPC calls.
   :webserver {:rpc {:ssl-host "0.0.0.0"
                     :ssl-port 9002
                     :ssl-key "dev-resources/ssl/key.pem"
                     :ssl-cert "dev-resources/ssl/cert.pem"
                     :ssl-ca-cert "dev-resources/ssl/ca.pem"})}
```

and two TK stacks, one with a bootstrap.cfg like this:

```
puppetlabs.trapperkeeper.rpc.services/rpc-server-service
gnarlytimes.services/math-service
```

and another like this:

```
gnarlytimes.services/remote-math-service
```

The latter can issue calls to the functions defined by `MathService`
as if the service was defined locally.

## Error handling

There are three classes of exceptions thrown by this library during an
RPC call. An **RPCConnectionException** is thrown when a given service's
endpoint is unreachable or otherwise uncommunicative. An
**RPCAuthenticationException** is thrown if the calling client's
certificate is not on the whitelist for that service on the server
side.

Should the remotely called service function throw an exception, the
stack trace from the remote server is returned as part of an
**RPCException**. This exception is also used for cases of
misconfiguration (ie trying to call a function that does not exist in
the RPC server's TK stack).
